# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers

#assumumptions

#psuedo code
#make an array from 100...999
#iterate over the array of numbers, multiplying every combination of two
#check if result is palindrome
#if so compare it against last stored palindrome
#repeat until largest palindrome is found
